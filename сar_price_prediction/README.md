Task description. Create a model that will predict the cost of a car based on its characteristics.

Description of the project files.

1. auto_parser.ipynb. It is intended for parsing data about cars from the site auto.ru and creating the train.csv training dataset.

2. car_price_prediction.ipynb. Notebook from kaggle with step-by-step solution of the task, including data preprocessing and model building.

The solution of the problem consisted of the following stages: 

1. Collecting data for model training using a parser or open sources.

2. Data cleaning and analysis, preprocessing.

3. Building a model for training and selecting parameters for better quality assessment (the MAPE metric was used as a metric).

The model on the collected data from auto.ru was worse than on the data from https://www.kaggle.com/macsunmood/autoru-parsed-0603-1304, so kaggle data was used.
