# spam_classifier

In this task, you need to write a spam classifier and train on data collected by the American anti-spam platform Apache SpamAssassin Project.

1. Write a model that predicts by text whether it is spam or not.
2. Wrap the model in a service so that mail services can communicate with the model â€“ send her emails and receive a "spam/not spam" response.
